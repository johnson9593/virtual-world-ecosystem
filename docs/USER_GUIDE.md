## Understanding Creature Types

### 🌿 Herbivore

## Managing Your Creatures

### Viewing Your Creatures
1. Click "My Creatures" in the navigation menu
2. You'll see all your creatures (alive and dead)
3. Each card shows:
   - Creature name and type
   - Current age (in days)
   - Health percentage (0-100%)
   - Energy percentage (0-100%)
   - Status (Alive or Dead)

### Understanding Stats

**Health (0-100%)**
- Decreases when energy is below 20%
- Increases when energy is above 80%
- Creature dies if health reaches 0%
- Green bar indicates current health

**Energy (0-100%)**
- Decreases each simulation cycle
- Restored by eating
- Critical when below 20%
- Blue bar indicates current energy

**Age**
- Measured in days (simulation cycles)
- Creatures can reproduce between ages 10-80
- Maximum lifespan is 100 days
- Older creatures are more experienced

### Creature Lifecycle

**Birth**
- Creatures are born with 100% health and energy
- Start at age 0
- Placed randomly on the world map

**Growth**
- Age increases by 1 each cycle (default: 30 seconds)
- Can reproduce when healthy (age 10-80)
- 5% reproduction chance per cycle when conditions are met

**Death**
- Occurs when health reaches 0%
- Occurs when energy reaches 0%
- Occurs at age 100 (old age)
- Carnivores can be hunted by other carnivores

## World Overview

### World Statistics
The World Overview shows:
- **Current Day**: How long the world has existed
- **Total Creatures**: Living creatures in the world
- **Herbivores**: Count of plant-eaters
- **Carnivores**: Count of hunters
- **Omnivores**: Count of balanced eaters
- **Food Available**: Plant food units in the world

### Creature Map
- Visual representation of all creatures
- Green dots = Herbivores
- Red dots = Carnivores
- Orange dots = Omnivores
- Larger rings = Healthier creatures
- Updates automatically every 10 seconds

### Understanding the Ecosystem

**Food Chain:**
```
Plants → Herbivores → Carnivores
         ↓
      Omnivores ← → Carnivores
```

**Resource Flow:**
1. Food grows at 50 units per cycle
2. Herbivores consume food
3. Carnivores hunt herbivores
4. Omnivores do both
5. Dead creatures don't consume resources

## Daily Reports

### What You'll Receive
Every day at 9:00 AM, you'll receive a report containing:
- Your total creature count
- Number of living creatures
- Number of deceased creatures
- Detailed stats for each living creature
- World population statistics
- Food availability

### Viewing Reports
1. Click "My Creatures" to see current status

## Tips for Success

### For Beginners
1. **Start with Herbivores**: They're easier to keep alive
2. **Create Multiple Creatures**: Don't put all eggs in one basket
3. **Monitor Daily**: Check your creatures regularly
4. **Watch the Food Supply**: Low food = danger for herbivores

### For Advanced Users
1. **Balance Your Portfolio**: Mix of all three types
2. **Strategic Timing**: Create creatures when food is abundant
3. **Population Control**: Too many carnivores = ecosystem collapse
4. **Reproduction Strategy**: Healthy creatures reproduce more

### Ecosystem Balance
- **Too Many Herbivores**: Food depletes quickly
- **Too Many Carnivores**: Herbivores go extinct, then carnivores starve
- **Balanced Mix**: Sustainable ecosystem
- **Monitor World Stats**: Adjust your strategy accordingly

### Survival Strategies

**For Herbivores:**
- Create them when food is above 1000 units
- Multiple herbivores increase survival odds
- Watch for carnivore population spikes

**For Carnivores:**
- Ensure adequate prey population
- Don't create too many at once
- Monitor their energy closely

**For Omnivores:**
- Most reliable long-term
- Good for maintaining presence
- Create during any conditions

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. ❌ Creating only one type of creature
2. ❌ Ignoring world food levels
3. ❌ Creating creatures during low food periods
4. ❌ Not checking on creatures regularly
5. ❌ Creating too many carnivores

### Best Practices
1. ✅ Diversify your creature types
2. ✅ Monitor world statistics
3. ✅ Create creatures strategically
4. ✅ Check daily reports
5. ✅ Maintain a balanced approach

A: No limit! Create as many as you want

**Q: Can creatures evolve or level up?**
A: Not in the current version, but it's a planned feature

**Q: Why did my creature die so quickly?**
A: Check the death reason - could be starvation, hunting, or bad luck

A: No, death is permanent. Create new creatures instead

**Q: How do I increase my chances of reproduction?**
A: Keep creatures healthy (>70% health and energy) between ages 10-80

**Q: What happens if all creatures die?**
A: The world continues, and you can create new creatures anytime

**Q: Can I rename my creatures?**
A: Not currently, choose names carefully when creating
